# A Portfolio Built as a System

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio.

Rather than treating a portfolio as a résumé or a gallery, I approached it as a **system** — something that reflects how I think, structure problems, and improve through iteration, with AI as a collaborator in the process.

## 🎯 Intent

Most portfolios focus on outcomes.

This one focuses on **decision-making**.

Every part of this project — layout, interaction, architecture, and deployment — was treated as a small but real product. AI tools were used to explore options, challenge assumptions, and accelerate iteration, while final decisions remained deliberate and human-driven.

The goal was not visual novelty, but clarity, coherence, and an honest representation of how I build when AI is part of my workflow.

## 🎨 Design Approach

The interface is intentionally restrained.

- Structure over decoration  
- Signal over noise  
- Fewer elements, used deliberately  

Early layout and hierarchy exploration were informed through AI-assisted ideation before being refined manually.

---

## 🧩 Implementation Notes

- Built with **Next.js (App Router)** and **TypeScript**
- AI was used during development to reason about component boundaries, refactoring options, and system flow
- Components are structured to separate intent, logic, and presentation
- Motion is subtle and functional, not ornamental
- Performance and responsiveness are treated as baseline requirements

3D and animation elements are used only where they add meaning — not spectacle.

## ☁️ Deployment

This project is deployed exactly as it exists in this repository.

- Containerized using Docker  
- Deployed on **Google Cloud Run**  
- Configured to scale to zero when idle  
- Designed to remain within free-tier limits  
- Treated as a production system, not a demo

## 🤖 Use of Google AI Tools

Google AI tools were used as collaborators to support exploration and iteration.

- **Google Stitch AI** — used during early design to explore layout structure and information hierarchy  
- **Google Antigravity** — used during development to assist with architectural reasoning and refactoring  

All final design and technical decisions were made deliberately and implemented manually.
